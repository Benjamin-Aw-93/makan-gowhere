This project is created to satify the requirements of IT5007.

Exisiting problem statement: 
As a group, it is often that nobody wants to speak up and make the final decision on behalf of everyone, simply because there are so many factors to consider - distance from where everyone is coming from, the mental budget that everyone has and even taste preferences. Thus, we are proposing a platform which takes all these factors into consideration and removes the need for users to decide on where to eat. 

The application aims to:

1. Be able to retrieve the geo location of a particular user 

2. Able to aggregate all food loactions (eateries, restaurants etc) onto one consolidated platform

3. Make meet-ups among friends a hassle free experience, while abstracting the need to make difficult decisions when selecting food choices

Summary of Goal:

- Create a readable frontend
- Map out states to make sure navigation between pages work okay
- Retrieve information of restaurants using API calls
- Make sure the state of the user is updated at every point of the application
- Link to backend where profile of the user resides

An expanded scope can be found in our project documentation.
